# pyGuess
A simple guess game made in python.

# How does it work?
The program takes 2 parameters, `min` and `max`. It then picks two random numbers between these values: the guess and the hint. You have to specify if the hint is the same, lower or higher than the guess. If your pick is correct, you win!

# How two install?
Make sure to put the file `pyGuess.py` in the same folder with your other python scripts. Use `from pyGuess import *` and run `start_guess(min, max)`.
